				I started my career in geomatics when I was a student, in my 2nd year of education at Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography. Later, trying to combine education and work, I moved from a cadastral survey company to a small family-owned civil construction company. After graduation, I was working in a high-rise industry as an on-site geomatic engineer.<br /><br />
