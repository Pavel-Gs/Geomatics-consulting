# A company's landing page

This is a simple React app - a landing page for a company or a proprietor.
The design idea (mostly - the layout) is taken from the "Backroads app" by John Smilga.

## Technologies used
### `React`
Component iterations, useState, useEffect.

### `SASS`
Mostly for nesting.

### `@media`
Media queries are set for all devices.

## Integrations
### `FormSubmit`
That integration, as the name suggests, provides easy form-submission functionality and automated replies.

### `Font Awesome`
Provides various icons and favicons, which are styled right in the code.

## How to use
There's nothing to use, really - it's just a one-page website, made of different React components.
